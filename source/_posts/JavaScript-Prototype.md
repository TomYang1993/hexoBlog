## JavaScript  has no class
essentially, JavaScript is not an OOP language, it is prototypr-based.

## Only function has prototype field
Object does not have prototype field because it makes no sense to let object have a prototype field,
function can create objects according to prototype, objects are not meant to create objects, and there is nothing to inherit from an object.
